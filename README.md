Thanks!

Notice!！

Because many people are very interested in this work, they encountered some problems when reproducing the results of the paper. In order to make it more convenient for everyone to participate in this work, I uploaded the pre-processed data, pre-training model and code to Baidu Netdisk. After entering the link, non-Chinese readers can click "下载" (meaning download) to download data, models and codes.
